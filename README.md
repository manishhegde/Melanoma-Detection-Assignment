## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.   
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis
- Data sets are used as images
