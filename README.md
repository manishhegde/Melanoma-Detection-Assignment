## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.   
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis
- Data sets are used as images 



## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis:The model is overfitting because we can also see difference in loss functions in training & test around the 10-11th epoch

The accuracy is just around 85-88% because there are enough features to remember the pattern
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis:There is small improvement in accuracy but we can definitely see the overfitting problem has solved due to data augmentation
We can increase the epochs to increase the accuracy 
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis: Accuracy on training data has decreased by using Augmentor library, and its now underfit 
                                  Model is good without Augmentor
                                  The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter
